	<p> Pickle hates Bean the cat because:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>he is bad and Pickle is an upright citizen and doesn't stand for that stort of thing</li>
	<li>he smells terrible</li>
	<li>he sometimes gets cuddles that are meant for Pickle and not Bean</li>
	<li>he is faster than Pickle</li></ul>
	<p>for these reasons, and many others, Pickle bites Bean's butt as often as he can.</p>
