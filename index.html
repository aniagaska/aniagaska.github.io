          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Anna and I'm a web developer and designer based in Queens, New
            York

          <p>
            I've worked on sites from the strategy stage to designing content
            and establishing the structure and functionality. As a volunteer
            with my local tech group, I developed my skills as a designer and
            web developer along side each other.

                    How to File a Freedom of Information Law Request

                    A Guide to the
                    <abbr title="Freedom of Information Law">FOIL</abbr> Request
                    Process in New York State
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I designed and built this site as a volunteer for Astoria
                    Digital. The goal was to to teach the FOIL request process,
                    provide resources to complete a request, and describe the
                    system critically so it can be improved.

                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    I created a child theme for Better Days Baking, a blog that
                    uses Wordpress
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I worked with a professionally trained baker on their
                    personal blog to establish the branding and apply styling to
                    the child theme. I worked with the baker from strategy to
                    launching and testing.

                    A CSS starter and a modular style guide for building

                  <p>
                    As a volunteer with Astoria Digital, I took our brand
                    guidelines and created an atomic, modular system to keep all
                    of our projects consistent. I collaborated with another
                    front end developer to create a CSS starter so projects
                    could start with similar front end code.

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            I am a front end web developer and designer with experience working
            on Wordpress sites. I enjoy building sites using CSS and HTML, and
            the process behind designing them from site map, wireframes, to
            comps.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a volunteer with
            <a href="http://astoria.digital">Astoria Digital</a>, I build and
            design tools to help my neighbors engage in volunteer groups in our
            community. Our work is open source and designed to be shared with
            other neighborhoods.
          </p>

            I'm based in Queens, New York. Ania is a Polish nickname for Anna
