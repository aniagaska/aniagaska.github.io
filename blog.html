		<h3>Dispute Over Portrait's Identity</h3>
		<p>Could it be the portrait of Jane Austen herself? Everyone wants a portrait of Jane Austen because she's so important to us, but was she valued enough by her family?</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/23/jane-austen-family-say-note-establishes-disputed-portraits-identity"> 
		An overlooked note that may have been written by Jane Austen’s great-niece Fanny Caroline Lefroy could put an end to the long-running question mark over an oil painting its owners believe is a depiction of the novelist as a teenager &mdash; a claim that has long been disputed by art experts.

		<h3>It is a truth universally acknowledged...</h3>
		<p>On Fresh Air, Geoff Nunberg talks about the cultural importance of the first line of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possesion of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." Often when it's quoted the irony is missed, but the irony is what sucks readers in and makes you love the author so much.</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.npr.org/2017/07/25/538609475/the-enduring-legacy-of-jane-austens-truth-universally-acknowledged">
		But we suspect that Austen has her reservations about that single-minded pursuit of an advantageous marriage, even if she doesn't say so outright. And we're flattered to think that she counts on astute readers like us to pick up on that, while others will miss it. It makes us feel complicit with her.</blockquote>

		<h3>Jane Austen's portrait is on the &pound;10 note</h3>
		<p>The good news is, Jane's face will be everywhere. The funny news is, that people keep taking quotes from her books out of context. It seems like the people in charge of choosing the quote didn't realize she was a comedian.</p>	
		<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/sep/12/plastic-10-pound-note-jane-austen-enter-circulation-thursday">A line from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice “I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!” will appear on the new notes, although the choice has sparked controversy. Critics say the words are said by a character with no interest in books at all, Caroline Bingley.</blockquote>
